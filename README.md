17. Get a two-digit number from user and make the one’s digit as 0, then print it.
18. Get a two-digit number from user and make the ten’s digit 1, then print it.
19. Get a three-digit number from user and make the one’s digit as 2, then print it.
20. Get a three-digit number from user and make the ten’s digit as 0, then print it.
21. Get a number from user and subtract 5 from that number if the number is odd, then print the result. Do not use “if”.
22. Get a number from user and subtract 5 from that number if the number’s ten’s position digit is odd, then print the result. Do not use “if”.
23. Get a two digit number from user and subtract 5 from that number if the sum of the digits of the number is odd, then print the result. Do not use “if”.
24. Get a three-digit number from user and subtract 5 from that number if one’s digit number and 100’s digit number are same, then print the result. Do not use “if”.
25. Get a four-digit number from user and subtract 5 from that number if ten’s digit position and 100’s digit position is same, then print the result. Do not use “if”.
26. Get a two-digit number from user. If the sum of the digits is 10 then print “Success”, otherwise print “Failure”.
27. Get a three-digit number from user. If the sum of the digits is 10 then print “Success”, otherwise print “Failure”.
28. Get a three-digit number from user. If the sum of the one’s digit and hundred’s digit is less than 10, then print “Success”, otherwise print “Failure”.
29. Get a four-digit number from user. If the sum of the ten’s digit and hundred’s digit is greater than 10, then print “Success”, otherwise print “Failure”.
30. Get a four-digit number from user. If the sum of the ten’s digit and hundred’s digit is equal to 10, and one of the digits is more than 7 then print “Success”, otherwise print “Failure”.
31. Get a three-digit number from user. If the sum of the digits is less than 10, then print the sum, otherwise add the digits of the sum, and print the sum. Note: The result should be always single digit only.
32. Get two 2-digit numbers from user. If the sum of the numbers is less than 100, then print the sum, otherwise print the difference.
33. Get two 2-digit numbers from user. Print the sum of digits of the biggest number.
